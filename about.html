<p> "At 'Let's Recycle and Reuse,' we're on a mission to revolutionize waste
management. Our online platform is designed to tackle the environmental
challenges of our time by providing you with a convenient solution for
responsible waste disposal. We believe in the power of collective action, and
that's why our project aims to empower individuals like you to make a
positive impact Our platform is a bridge between your home wastage and a greener, more
sustainable future. We understand that waste is a valuable resource, and our
goal is to ensure that it's not wasted. By collecting plastic, wood, clothes, and
other reusable products, recycling them based on your preferences, and
returning the repurposed items to you, we're creating a closed loop of
environmental responsibility.
Our project isn't just a website; it's an intermediary that puts you in control
of the recycling process. We envision a world where recycling and reusing are
seamless habits, where each action taken contributes to a circular economy
and a cleaner planet. Our commitment extends beyond convenience – we'rehere to educate, inspire, and build a community of conscious consumers.
Join us in this exciting journey of transforming your home wastage into
valuable resources. 'Let's Recycle and Reuse' isn't just about a project; it's a
movement. Together, let's reshape the way we handle waste, one recycled
item at a time, and leave a positive legacy for future generations.".</p>

   <h1>Plastic <span>Recycling</span> </h1>
   <p> Plastic that is collected from your homes, businesses, and local recycling centres, is sent to a Material Recovery Facilities (MRF), which separates plastic and non-plastic, and/or a Plastic Recovery Facilities (PRF), which sorts plastic by type. These facilites use sorting equipment such as an optical sorter which can distinguish between between different types of plastics.  The plastic then goes to a reprocesses where it is washed,  shredded and sorted further. The plastic is then melted and extruded a into new recycled plastic pellets. These pellets are sold on for use in new products. This page will now explain each stage in more detail.</p>

   <h1> <span>Metal</span>Recycling </h1>
   <p> Metals are a critical material in our daily lives, and it’s easy to take them for granted. 

We cook using pots and pans made from metal, our cars are made up of various metal parts (engines too!), the buildings we live in contain metal supports, and most importantly, our favourite beers come in metal cans. How could humanity survive without this vital resource? 

Many of the world’s products are metal-containing, and sadly, a large amount of these products end up in landfills. Thankfully, a way to circumvent this type of unnecessary waste is to bring your metal scrap to companies like Federal Metals. </p>

   <p> The process of waste paper recycling most often involves mixing used/old paper with water and chemicals to break it down. It is then chopped up and heated, which breaks it down further into strands of cellulose, a type of organic plant material; this resulting mixture is called pulp, or slurry. It is strained through screens, which remove plastic (especially from plastic-coated paper) that may still be in the mixture. It is then cleaned, de-inked (ink is removed), bleached, and mixed with water. Then it can be made into new recycled paper.[4]

The share of ink in a wastepaper stock is up to about 2% of the total weight.</p>

   <p> The processed wood is then chipped into small pieces, screened to remove any large or irregular pieces, and ground into a finer material known as wood mulch. Wood mulch can be composted to produce a high-quality organic soil amendment or burned as a fuel source to produce heat and electricity.</p>

   <p> Mechanical recycling of textiles is the process of recycling the textile fabric back into fibres without the use of any chemicals. This process includes shredding and carding process to extract the fibres from the fabric. This fibre can then be spun to make yarn for either woven or knitted fabric. Mechanical recycling is used best for the mono-fibre fabric of cotton and rarely viscose due to the fibre structure and higher fibre yield.
